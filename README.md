Day 1 of my 90 Days MERN Journey — A complete HTML-only guide explaining how to become a Frontend Developer
# Day 1 — HTML Only Project  
### 📘 Topic: How to Become a Frontend Developer

This is my Day 1 project of the **90 Days MERN Journey**.  
In this project, I created a complete HTML-only webpage that explains:

- Who is a Frontend Developer  
- Skills required  
- Step-by-step roadmap  
- Useful developer resources  
- An illustration representing frontend development  

The project uses **only basic HTML tags** like:  
`<h1>–<h6>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, `<a>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<hr>`, `<br>`
